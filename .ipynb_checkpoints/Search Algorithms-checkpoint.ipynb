    "    - Time complexity:\n",
    "        - Best Case: In the best case, the key might be present at the first index. So the best case complexity is O(1)\n",
    "        - Worst Case: In the worst case, the key might be present at the last index i.e., opposite to the end from which the search has started in the list. So the worst-case complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the list.\n",
    "        - Average Case: O(N)\n",
    "    - Auxiliary Space: O(1) as except for the variable to iterate through the list, no other variable is used. \n",

    "        1. Start from the first element (index 0) and compare key with each element (arr[i]).\n",

    "- **Sentinel Search**: The basic idea of Sentinel Linear Search is to add an extra element at the end of the array (i.e., the sentinel value) that matches the search key. By doing so, we can avoid the conditional check for the end of the array in the loop and terminate the search early, as soon as we find the sentinel element. This eliminates the need for a separate check for the end of the array, resulting in a slight improvement in the average case performance of the algorithm.\n",

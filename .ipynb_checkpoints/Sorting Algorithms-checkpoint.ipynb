    "- Time Complexity: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O($N^2$) as there are two nested loops:\n",
    "    - One loop to select an element of Array one by one = O(N)\n",
    "    - Another loop to compare that element with every other Array element = O(N)\n",
    "    - Therefore overall complexity = O(N) * O(N) = O(N*N) = O($N^2$)\n",
    "- Auxiliary Space: O(1) as the only extra memory used is for temporary variables while swapping two values in Array. The selection sort never makes more than O(N) swaps and can be useful when memory writing is costly. \n",

    "### Merge sort \n",
    "- Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be further divided i.e., the array has only one element left (an array with one element is always sorted). Then the sorted subarrays are merged into one sorted array.\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N log(N)),  Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and time complexity can be expressed as following recurrence relation. $T(n) = 2T\\frac{n}{2} + \\theta(n)$\n",
    "- Auxiliary Space: O(N), In merge sort all elements are copied into an auxiliary array. So N auxiliary space is required for merge sort.\n",
    "- Applications of Merge Sort:\n",
    "    - Sorting large datasets: Merge sort is particularly well-suited for sorting large datasets due to its guaranteed worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).\n",
    "    - External sorting: Merge sort is commonly used in external sorting, where the data to be sorted is too large to fit into memory.\n",
    "    - Custom sorting: Merge sort can be adapted to handle different input distributions, such as partially sorted, nearly sorted, or completely unsorted data.\n",
    "- Advantages of Merge Sort:\n",
    "    - Stability: Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.\n",
    "    - Guaranteed worst-case performance: Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(N logN), which means it performs well even on large datasets.\n",
    "    - Parallelizable: Merge sort is a naturally parallelizable algorithm, which means it can be easily parallelized to take advantage of multiple processors or threads.\n",
    "- Drawbacks of Merge Sort:\n",
    "    - Space complexity: Merge sort requires additional memory to store the merged sub-arrays during the sorting process. \n",
    "    - Not in-place: Merge sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it requires additional memory to store the sorted data. This can be a disadvantage in applications where memory usage is a concern.\n",
    "    - Not always optimal for small datasets: For small datasets, Merge sort has a higher time complexity than some other sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort. This can result in slower performance for very small datasets.\n",

    "    - last element\n",
    "    - random element\n",
    "- Time Complexity:\n",
    "    - Best Case:  $\\Omega(N log (N))$ The best-case scenario for quicksort occur when the pivot chosen at the each step divides the array into roughly equal halves.\n",
    "    - Average Case:  \\theta( N log (N)) Quicksort’s average-case performance is usually very good in practice, making it one of the fastest sorting Algorithm.\n",
    "    - Worst Case: O($N^2$) The worst-case Scenario for Quicksort occur when the pivot at each step consistently results in highly unbalanced partitions.\n",
    "- Auxiliary Space: O(1), if we don’t consider the recursive stack space. If we consider the recursive stack space then, in the worst case quicksort could make O(N).\n",
    "- Advantages of Quick Sort:\n",
    "    - It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that makes it easier to solve problems.\n",
    "    - It is efficient on large data sets.\n",
    "    - It has a low overhead, as it only requires a small amount of memory to function.\n",
    "- Disadvantages of Quick Sort:\n",
    "    - It has a worst-case time complexity of O(N2), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly.\n",
    "    - It is not a good choice for small data sets.\n",
    "    - It is not a stable sort, meaning that if two elements have the same key, their relative order will not be preserved in the sorted output in case of quick sort, because here we are swapping elements according to the pivot’s position (without considering their original positions).\n",
